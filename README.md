# -Semantic-Similarity
 build an intelligent system that users are asked to pick a synonym of a word out of a list of alternatives
 
 One type of question encountered in the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is the “Synonym
 Question”, where students are asked to pick a synonym of a word out of a list of alternatives. For example:
 
     1. vexed                                                  (Answer: (a) annoyed)
     
    (a) annoyed
    
    (b) amused
    
    (c) frightened
    
    (d) excited
    
For this assignment, you will build an intelligent system that can learn to answer questions like this one. In order to do that, the system will approximate the semantic similarity of any pair of words. The semantic similarity between two words is the measure of the closeness of their meanings.
